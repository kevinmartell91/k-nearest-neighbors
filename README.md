# Machine Learning Models Project

This project contains machine learning models for classification tasks.

## File Structure

- `algorithms/`: Contains implementations of different algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions for model evaluation and saving.
- `exception.py`: Defines custom exceptions for the project.
- `logger.py`: Handles logging for the project.
- `model_trainer.py`: Contains the `ModelTrainer` class for training machine learning models.

## Usage

To train machine learning models, use the `ModelTrainer` class in `model_trainer.py`. Provide the necessary dataset object and mode for training.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries specified in the project's requirements.txt file.
